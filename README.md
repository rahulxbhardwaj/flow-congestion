# 🚀 Flow and Congestion Control Visualization

A simple **Python-based GUI simulation** demonstrating **Stop-and-Wait** and **Sliding Window** flow control protocols using Tkinter.

## ✨ Features
- 🔄 **Stop-and-Wait Protocol**: Simulates packet transmission with ACK and timeout handling.
- 📡 **Sliding Window Protocol**: Demonstrates multiple packets in transit with selective ACKs.
- 🎬 **Animated Visualization**: Packets move between sender and receiver in real-time.
- ⚡ **Random Network Conditions**: Simulates packet loss, delays, and retransmissions.

## 📥 Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulxbhardwaj/flow-congestion.git
   cd flow-congestion
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (Only Tkinter is required, included in Python by default):
   ```bash
   pip install tk
   ```
3. **Run the simulation:**
   ```bash
   python flow_control_gui.py
   ```

## 🛠 How It Works
1. **Select a protocol**: Choose between **Stop-and-Wait** or **Sliding Window**.
2. **Start Simulation**: Click the button to begin.
3. **Observe real-time transmission**: Watch packet movement, ACK responses, and retransmissions in action.
