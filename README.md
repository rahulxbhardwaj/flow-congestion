Flow and Congestion Control Visualization

A simple Python-based GUI simulation demonstrating Stop-and-Wait and Sliding Window flow control protocols using Tkinter.

Features

Stop-and-Wait Protocol: Simulates packet transmission with ACK and timeout handling.

Sliding Window Protocol: Demonstrates multiple packets in transit with selective ACKs.

Animated Visualization: Packets move between sender and receiver in real-time.

Random Network Conditions: Simulates packet loss, delays, and retransmissions.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/rahulxbhardwaj/flow-congestion.git
cd flow-congestion

Install dependencies (only Tkinter is required, included in Python by default):

pip install tk

Run the simulation:

python flow_control_gui.py

How It Works

Choose a protocol (Stop-and-Wait or Sliding Window).

Click Start Simulation to visualize packet transmission.

Observe real-time movement, ACKs, and retransmissions.
